# Introduction

Security/safety and extensibility/scalability are two pairs of quality attributes that is of great importance in software architecture. This articles discusses about their definitions and comparisons, followed by their respective general scenarios, which are complemented with typical concrete scenarios to give reader a clearer and concrete picture. Finally, some strategies and tactics to improve each attribute are given, each with description, benefits and penalities.

It is the first assignment for course *Software Architecture* of NJUSE.

# Definitions and Comparisons

In this part, the definitions of, relationships and differences between selected pairs of quality attributes (security/safety and extensibility/scalability) are analyzed and presented with examples.

## Safety/Security

A "safe" system is such that the harm from accidental mishaps to the system itself can be minimized or avoided. A "secure" system is such that some important properties of a system (like integrity, access, accountability, availability and confidentiality) can still be maintained under intentional attacks.

In another word, "safety" means the ability to reduce the risk of and harm from **unintentional** mishaps to the system‚Äôs stakeholders and valuable assets, whereas the "security" indicates lowering of the risk of and harm from **intentional** attacks.

It can be observed that both attributes require a system to be able to **preserve important properties** of a system and **minimize the harm**, but from difference types of accidents.

"Safety" focuses on **unintentional** incidents, i.e. the incidents that not meant to cause damage to the system itself. For example, a "safe" social media system should still be functional if one of its servers is disconnected from Internet because of a maloperation during a construction (like cutting a critical wire by mistake); an artificial satellite should keep intact for its major components operational when facing a strong cosmic ray, but some degree of slowdown is tolerable; in a safety system, important data (like financial transactions) won‚Äôt be unrecoverably lost if a disk containing these data malfunctions unexpectedly.

"Security", on the other hand, talks about **intentional** attacks, i.e. the attacks that targets to the system from the very beginning. For example, in a secure system, no plaintext passwords shall be compromised when hackers are attacking database; a medical system should hold long enough under terroristic cyber attacks to be able to get professional assists from law enforcement department, since a breakdown of such system might cause disasters; if a hacker had gained access to the system illegally, the system should be able to detect their existence, remove their privilege, and then report the bug that was abused as soon as possible.

## Extensibility/Scalability

System always grows as time goes, but by two directions: **vertically** or **horizontally**. A system might need to implement more functions than originally anticipated or change the implementation that has already been made (vertically); a system might also be required to process more requests without excessive changes to the system itself in the future (horizontally).

Both extensibility and scalability focus on the growth of a system, but from difference perspective. Extensibility is the ability to **extend vertically**: that is to add "extensions" (like new features, modification to existing modules etc.) without too much changes and impacts to be expected. Scalability, on the other hand, is the ability and potential to **scale horizontally**: i.e. the ability to effectively handle growing or reducing amount of work using existing system or with minimal changes to the system itself as the number of works increases or decreases.

For example, an extensible frontend project usually indicates that adding a new page (to meet newly-derived business requirements) can be easily implemented without a deep dive into existing code. It also might mean that changing a style to an existing common component can be done within one place which takes effect for all of its occurrences. An extensible system with complex dataflow should be able to integrate a data processing module without an overhaul to the whole dataflow.

As for scalability, existing cloud service providers (Microsoft Azure, AWS etc.) all provide a scalable infrastructure that can gradually accommodate more demands as more companies are migrating their services to cloud based platform for better performance, maintainability and cost. A new concept of computing, serverless or functional computing, are gaining ground in cloud service territory because of its "infinite scalability", which means a service can adapt to handle any amounts of requests the service is actually facing, freeing developers from caring infrastructure and codebase themselves as the number of requests increases.

# General and Concrete Scenarios

In this part, scenario-based analysis method is applied on the aforementioned pairs of quality attributes to create their general and two concrete scenarios respectively.

Safety minimizes harm from unintentional accidents, while security protects against intentional attacks. Extensibility enables vertical system expansion (adding features), whereas scalability handles horizontal growth (increased workload). General and concrete scenarios illustrate each attribute‚Äôs application, with safety focusing on redundancy and monitoring, and security emphasizing vulnerability testing and isolation. Extensibility strategies include modular design and refactoring, while scalability employs partitioning and caching.

article examines two pairs of software architecture quality attributes: security/safety and extensibility/scalability. Safety minimizes harm from unintentional accidents, while security protects against intentional attacks. Extensibility enables vertical system expansion (adding features), whereas scalability handles horizontal growth (increased workload). General and concrete scenarios illustrate each attribute‚Äôs application, with safety focusing on redundancy and monitoring, and security emphasizing vulnerability testing and isolation.
